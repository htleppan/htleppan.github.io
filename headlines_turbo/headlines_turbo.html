<h1>Headlines Turbo</h1>

<p> Headlines Turbo was a news reader app that downloaded news articles 
from multiple sources, grouped them by content similarity, and displayed 
them to the user in a compact view. The aim was to provide fast 
access to relevant news topics, in which the relevancy was determined by 
the popularity of the topic across multiple sources. Secondary objective 
was to bring multiple viewpoints of politically biased topics in the 
same view, which was useful especially when reading the U.S. newsphere.

A clustering algorithm was developed that was transparent to language, 
i.e. the algorithm did not use pre-programmed stop words or stemming 
that were commonly used in other algorithms. This made the scaling of the app to other 
languages practically effortless.

The app was written in Objective-C, with the algorithm being prototyped 
in Python. Especially challenging was to optimize the algorithm performance 
such that it would run smoothly on a mobile device. If I recall 
correctly, the total clustering time was brought from initial 1-2 minutes to 
less than a second by using CPU caching and C++ in the critical parts.

The app was available in App Store in 2013 - 2017 but removed due to not 
being a commercial success. Also, updating to later iOS versions would 
have required substantial amount of time and effort.
